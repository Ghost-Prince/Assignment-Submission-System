--------------Example run--------------------

Here is an example of how to use this schema for a given scenario:

A faculty member with _id "123" creates an assignment with _id "456" for batch "B1" in branch "CS".
{
  "_id": ObjectId("456"),
  "title": "Assignment 1",
  "description": "Write a program in Java to do X, Y, and Z",
  "dueDate": ISODate("2023-03-01T00:00:00Z"),
  "batch": "B1",
  "branch": "CS",
  "facultyId": ObjectId("123")
}

All students in batch "B1" in branch "CS" can view this assignment on their dashboard.
A student with _id "789" submits a link to their assignment for assignment with _id "456".
{
  "_id": ObjectId("789abc"),
  "studentId": ObjectId("789"),
  "assignmentId": ObjectId("456"),
  "link": "https://github.com/abc",
  "dateSubmitted": ISODate("2023-02-22T10:00:00Z")
}

The faculty member with _id "123" can view all submissions for assignment with _id "456".
db.submissions.find({ assignmentId: ObjectId("456") })
